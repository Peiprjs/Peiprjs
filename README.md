# This is Peipr
Hi! My name is Peipr, also known as Pol R. I'm a pre-universitary student who loves all things computer. In my free time I repair electronics, organize a local branch of the #RightToRepair movement and read, a lot.

## My current projects
I'm the lead developer (and only for now) of Peiphy Industries, a company I opened. You can comission me to make you something. My code is that of quality, and I attempt my best at optimizing it. PeiPhy has a Discord bot I mainly use for testing out APIs and new things I find, and a Roblox SaleBot, which is still in development and will go closed-source (mostly) when it's finished.
I'm also the Engineering and Avionics Manager for the AEC (Catalan Space Association), and currently working on the avionics that will hopefully fly in the new GEA-1, the start of a new era for european space travel.

## My favourites
+ My favourite OS is Parrot OS (the Security version, ofc)
+ My favourite computer is my modded HP 6530b, with a 1TB SSD and 8GB of RAM, it works flawlessly.
+ My favourite TV series are those of the 2000's, especially Code Lyoko and Miraculous Ladybug.
+ My favourite book is called "La truita cremada".
